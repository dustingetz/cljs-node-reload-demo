This is an attempt to see node hot code reloading work with boot figreload.

It doesn't work right now in this project.

Node- http://localhost:3000

    boot node
    cd target/node; node preamble.js # in second terminal

Browserâ€“ http://localhost:3000

    boot browser

Browser works fine; node doesn't detect changes.
